title: Configure the Coursemaker Gatsby Theme
number: 3
---

In the `gatsby-config.js` you will find a field called `siteMetadata`. This controls the configuration for the school (more
on defining a `school` in the next section):

```js
module.exports = {
  siteMetadata: {
    title: "Demo Site Cool School",
    owner: {
      email: "chris@coursemaker.org",
    },
    landing_page: {
      title_and_description: {
        title: "The CourseMaker Demo School",
        description: description_string,
      },
      primary_button: {
        text: "View Courses",
        color: "green",
        text_color: "white",
      },
      cta_section: {
        title: "Everything you need to use CourseMaker's Tools",
        description: cta_description_string,
      },
      cta_button: {
        text: "View Courses",
        color: "green",
        text_color: "white",
      },
    },
    stripe_public_key: "update me",
  },
  ...
```

The theme can also take options:

```js
plugins: [
    {
      resolve: `@coursemaker/gatsby-theme-coursemaker`,
      options: {
        coursesPath: "schoolMDX/courses",
        authorsPath: "schoolMDX/authors",
      },
    },
```

Notable options include:
`coursesPath`: the directory where your course files will be detected
`authorsPath`: the directory where your author files will be detected
