To create a new course, add a directory underneath `school/courses`.

There is a course-level `index.mdx` file which sits in the course directory (not to be confused with section-level `index.mdx`
files). Which allows you to define course properties in the [frontmatter](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/adding-markdown-pages/#frontmatter-for-metadata-in-markdown-files)

`title`: course title
`courseImage`: Image that will represent the course (appears on course landing page)
`courseVideoID`: Course video that will represent the course (appears on course landing page) - this should be a youtube video ID.
`subtitle`: Appears underneath the course title on the course landing page
`author`: Must match an author found in the `authors.yml` (see next lecture)
