The top-most entity you will be working with is that of a `school`. A school contains many courses. Courses are made up
of lectures, which are grouped into sections.

```
school/
└── authors/
|	├── authors.yml
|	└── assets/
|		├── author.jpg
└── courses/
|	└── course1/
|   	index.mdx
|		└── assets/
|			├── cover.jpg
|   	└── section1/
|       	├── index.mdx
|       	├── lecture1.mdx
|       	├── lecture2.mdx
|   	└── section2/
|       	├── index.mdx
|       	├── lecture3.mdx
|       	├── lecture4.mdx
|	└── course2/
|   	index.mdx
|   	└── section1/
|       	├── index.mdx
|       	├── lecture1.mdx
|       	├── lecture2.mdx
|   	└── section2/
|       	├── index.mdx
|       	├── lecture3.mdx
|       	├── lecture4.mdx
```

You will notice that these files are not "vanilla" markdown (.md) files, but rather .mdx files which allows you to
write JSX inside embedded markdown ([more information here](https://github.com/mdx-js/mdx)).
