Get your test credentials from Stripe
Selling products on our site will require both the publishable key and the secret key for our Stripe account. We’ll stay in test mode so we can run through the transactions without spending real money.

To get these values, we need to:

Log into Stripe at https://dashboard.stripe.com/login
Make sure the “Viewing test data” switch is toggled on
Click “Developers” in the left-hand menu
Click “API keys”
Copy both the publishable key and secret key from the “Standard keys” panel

On the site’s admin dashboard, do the following:

Click “Deploys” in the top nav
Click “Deploy settings”
Click “Envoronment” in the left-hand nav
Click “Edit variables” and add STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY and STRIPE_SECRET_KEY with the corresponding values from Stripe, then save
