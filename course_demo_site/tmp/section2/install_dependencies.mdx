2. Install [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/#mac-stable)
3. Clone the [example project](https://github.com/CourseMaker/academy) (which is also this course!)
4. `cd` into the directory which contains the `gatsby-config.js`, then run `yarn` to install dependencies, including
the @coursemaker/gatsby-theme-coursemaker
5. Once dependencies are installed, start your local server with the `gatsby develop` command.
